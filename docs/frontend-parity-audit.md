# Frontend Parity Audit

## Scope

This file tracks which source-language frontend slices are reflected in the current native compiler scaffold.

## Current status

### Implemented

- lexing for package, import, type, record, choice, interface, implements, extend, function, public, private, from, as, shared, exclusive, let, var, return, switch, default, guard, if, else, while, for, in, defer, break, continue, repeat, where, `async`, `await`, `task`, `thread`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `bit_and`, `bit_or`, `bit_xor`, `bit_not`, `shift_left`, `shift_right`, `true`, and `false` keywords
- indentation-sensitive block structure with explicit `indent` and `dedent` tokens
- package declarations, import blocks, type aliases, record declarations, choice declarations, interface declarations, `implements` declarations, `extend` declarations, function headers, and single-line `where` clauses
- parsed top-level visibility modifiers for supported declarations plus field visibility modifiers in records
- parsed choice variants including payload-bearing variants and generic choice parameter lists
- parsed interface method signatures including generic interface parameter lists, `implements Interface for Type` method blocks, and `extend Type` method blocks with method visibility
- parsed record fields, typed parameters, return types, generic `where` constraints, nested generic type syntax, and `shared`/`exclusive`-qualified type names
- statement parsing for `let`, `var`, plain `=` assignment, `return`, `break`, `continue`, expression statements, inline and block-arm `switch`, `guard ... else`, `if` with an optional `else` block, `while`, `repeat ... while`, `for ... in`, block `unsafe`, and block `defer`
- expression parsing for names, decimal/hex/binary integer literals, string literals, boolean literals, array literals, `task` and `thread` block expressions, unary `-`, `not`, `bit_not`, and `await`, calls, member access, null-safe member access, index access, ternary `?:`, and binary `+`, `-`, `*`, `%`, `/`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `and`, `or`, `bit_and`, `bit_or`, `bit_xor`, `shift_left`, and `shift_right`
- first semantic validation for concurrency surface rules: `await` and `task` now produce frontend diagnostics when used outside `async` functions or methods, `task`/`thread` bodies must end in a value-producing statement shape, concurrency bodies now reject captures of mutable outer locals and receiver `this`, and the semantics pass now classifies captured outer values for later typed checks
- CLI parse output for import/type/choice/interface/implementation/extension counts, declaration visibility, implementation/extension targets, function `where` constraints, and first-statement nested/alternate/switch-arm counts

### Pending

- additional top-level forms and modifiers from the updated docs
- richer expression, literal, and pattern grammar beyond the current narrow subset
- semantic analysis, type checking, ownership checking, lowering, and backend code generation

## Latest update

- 2026-04-26: introduced explicit concurrency-capture classification in the semantics result, kept the existing placeholder diagnostics on top of that data, extended smoke coverage, and synchronized the parity records.
