# ADR-0006: Dynamic Sequence Lowering Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The current lowering path supports fixed-size `Array<T, N>` iteration, partial `View<T>` pointer-style ABI handling,
and no `DynamicArray<T>` lowered function-signature support. Before implementing dynamic `for ... in` lowering, the
compiler needs an internal model that separates source-level sequence ownership and access mode from the eventual LLVM
representation.

## Decision

- Lowering classifies `DynamicArray<T>` and `View<T>`-shaped source types as dynamic sequences before emitters decide
  whether a use site is currently supported.
- `DynamicArray<T>` is the owned contiguous dynamic sequence form. Its target ABI model is a descriptor containing a
  data pointer, a length, and a capacity.
- `View<T>`, `shared.View<T>`, and `exclusive.View<T>` are non-owning contiguous sequence views. Their target ABI model
  is a descriptor containing a data pointer and a length.
- View-shaped function parameters and returns lower to the descriptor ABI as `{ ptr, i64 }`.
- Shared/exclusive access is tracked as source-type metadata, not by inventing different LLVM pointer spellings.
- The current fixed-array-only `for` lowering diagnostic remains valid until loop lowering consumes this model and
  emits descriptor-aware indexing and bounds.

## Consequences

- Dynamic sequence support can be added without changing the source grammar.
- Emitters have a single query for dynamic sequence element type, ownership, and mutation capability.
- View parameter indexing extracts the descriptor data pointer before element addressing. Length-aware bounds and
  dynamic iteration remain future work.

## Follow-up work

- Define `DynamicArray<T>` allocation, drop, and capacity invariants before enabling owned dynamic-array values in
  lowered signatures.
- Extend `for ... in` lowering to consume dynamic sequence descriptors after descriptor ABI support is in place.
