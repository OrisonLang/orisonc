# ADR-0001: C++23 Frontend with LLVM Backend

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Orison is intended to ship as a serious native toolchain with a compiler driver, formatter,
and language server built from shared internal libraries. The implementation needs predictable
native performance, direct control over memory and data layout, and practical integration with
existing backend and object-generation infrastructure.

## Decision

The Orison implementation stack will use:

- `C++23` for the compiler, shared libraries, and supporting tools
- `LLVM` as the core backend and code generation stack

The repository scaffold should reflect a modular internal architecture so the compiler driver,
formatter, and language server can share source management, diagnostics, syntax, semantic
analysis, and lowering components.

## Consequences

- The build system should standardize on a `CMake`-based native workflow.
- Repository layout should separate reusable compiler libraries from tool entry points and tests.
- Early scaffolding can remain independent from linked LLVM components until the backend layer is introduced.
- Future ADRs should define the lowering pipeline, incremental compilation architecture, and runtime boundary.

## Follow-up work

- Add the first shared foundation/source/diagnostics libraries.
- Define the initial frontend pipeline from source text to parsed syntax trees.
- Introduce explicit LLVM discovery and backend targets once lowering begins.
